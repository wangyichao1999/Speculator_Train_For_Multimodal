## Overview

Speculators is a unified library for building, training and storing speculative decoding algorithms for large language model (LLM) inference, including in frameworks like vLLM. Speculative decoding is a lossless technique that speeds up LLM inference by using a smaller, faster draft model (i.e "the speculator") to propose tokens, which are then verified by the larger base model, reducing latency without compromising output quality. The speculator intelligently drafts multiple tokens ahead of time, and the base model verifies them in a single forward pass. This approach boosts performance without sacrificing output quality, as every accepted token is guaranteed to match what the main model would have generated on its own.

Speculators standardizes this process by providing a productionized end-to-end framework to train draft models with reusable formats and tools. Trained models can seamlessly run in vLLM, enabling the deployment of speculative decoding in production-grade inference servers.

## Key Features

- **Offline Training Data Generation using vLLM:** Enable the generation of hidden states using vLLM. Data samples are saved to disk and can be used for draft model training.
- **Draft Model Training Support:** E2E training support of single and multi-layer draft models. Training is supported for MoE, non-MoE, and Vision Language models.
- **Standardized, Extensible Format:** Provides a Hugging Face-compatible format for defining speculative models, with tools to convert from external research repositories into a standard speculators format for easy adoption.
- **Seamless vLLM Integration:** Built for direct deployment into vLLM, enabling low-latency, production-grade inference with minimal overhead.

## Examples

End-To-End Training Examples:

- [Train Llama3 Draft Model](https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators/blob/main/examples/data_generation_and_training/llama3_8b_sharegpt_5k.py)
- [Train Qwen3 (Non-MoE) Draft Model](https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators/blob/main/examples/data_generation_and_training/qwen3_8b_sharegpt_ultrachat.py)
- [Train GPT-OSS Draft Model](https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators/blob/main/examples/data_generation_and_training/gpt_oss_20b_ultrachat_5k.py)

## vLLM Inference

Models trained through Speculators can run seamlessly in vLLM using a simple `vllm serve <speculator_model>` command. This will run the model in vLLM using default arguments, defined in the `speculator_config` of the model's config.json.

```bash
vllm serve RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-speculator.eagle3
```

Served models can then be benchmarked using [GuideLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm). Below, we show sample benchmark results where we compare our speculator with its dense counterpart. We also additionally compare [quantization](https://github.com/vllm-project/llm-compressor) to explore additional performance improvements by swapping the dense verifier, `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` with the quantized FP8 model, [RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-FP8-dynamic](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-FP8-dynamic) in the `speculator_config`.
