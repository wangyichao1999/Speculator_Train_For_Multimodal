# Data Generation and Training

Speculators currently supports training of Eagle3 speculative decoders. For full details on all the steps described below, see [README.md](/scripts/README.md)

This process is currently broken down into three key steps:

1. Data Generation
2. Vocab Mapping
3. Training

## Data Generation

Generate hidden states for training using vLLM. Dataset values are passed through the target or verifier model and generated hidden states are saved to disk for further use. `scripts/data_generation_offline.py` provides the main entry point for generating training data for Eagle3 models.

Once completed, the following files will be generated on disk:

1. `token_freq.pt` (the token frequency distribution file)
2. `data_config.json` (data metadata)
3. data pt files containing the hidden state values

Note: this process uses vLLM and requires the `datagen` optional install.

## Vocab Mapping

Build `d2t` and `t2d` files from the token frequency distribution file. `scripts/build_vocab_mapping.py` is the main entrypoint for this step.

Once completed, the following files will be generated from this step on disk:

1. `d2t.npy`
2. `t2d.npy`

## Training

Train an Eagle3 draft model or `speculator`. Currently, training is supported for:

1. Single-Layer and Multi-Layer Draft Models for Non-MoE models
2. Single-Layer and Multi-Layer Draft Models of certain Non-Vision MoEs

For a full list of models with support, see: https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators/blob/main/README.md

`scripts/train.py` provides the main entry point for training Eagle3 models with support for single and multi GPU training using FSDP.

# Examples

The files in this folder provide end-to-end examples which run the three steps listed above for GPT-OSS, Llama3 and Qwen3 draft models. If at any point a step fails, you can rerun the script and continue from the last step. Seprate steps may also run using the individual scripts listed above.
